   <p>In 2022, heavy tensions
      broke out between the Democratic 
      Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, which have led to several alleged attacks by Congolese and Rwandan 
      forces on each other's territory. Rwandan forces have been caught crossing into the DRC multiple times,
      usually fighting alongside Congolese rebels.
      The crisis is related to an ongoing offensive beginning in March 2022 by the March 23 Movement (M23), 
      which the Congo and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of not only supporting but actively fighting
       for Rwanda and M23 have also accused the DRC of working together with the Democratic 
      Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a racist Hutu Power paramilitary group that took
      part in the Rwandan Genocide.Both the Congo and Rwanda deny they support the FDLR and M23, 
      respectively,contrary to research and reports that confirm both sides' allegations.
      The MONUSCO peacekeeping mission maintains that it is
       not involved in the conflict,13needs update but has been accused by Rwanda of taking sides.</p>
